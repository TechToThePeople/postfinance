Swiss payment system PostFinance for CiviCRM
-----------------------------------

PostFinance: Swiss people are good at branding. It's a payment system developped by the Swiss Post, and this is a civicrm extension to interface with it.

Partly funded by TEDx Lausanne (you should attend, they have awesome speakers). 

If you are using it, please consider contributing financially to its development too. 

By all means, feel free to contact us if you need some help for your civicrm project, we are based in Geneva. xavier.dutoit@tttp.eu

Installation
----------

Postfinance account
=========

You need a post account in swizerland, and you need to contact them. They will probably insist you need to meet their commercial, but you should be able to quickly get the basic postFinance account (postfinance to postfinance account payment), and resonnably soon a full account.

They will provide you a PSPID (Postfinance Merchant ID) that you need to set up the account

CiviCRM Payment processor
================
Download and enable this extension. Once done, you need to create a payment processor (Administer/System Settings/Payment Processors). Configure it with your PSPID account and set is as enabled and the default.

That's it. Create a payment page or a paid event and test.
